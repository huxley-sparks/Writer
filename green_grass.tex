            Leaning over with his back on the railing, Quinn's head is upside down and looking ahead. Besides him, Alex directs his eyes towards his friend
        that appears to be covered in black and red vertical stripes originating from the collar to his pants if clothes could match his chaotic behavior. Quinn
        laughs as Alex smiles, shaking his head at the thought that passes in his friend's head. "You know you're going to fall in right?" "I assume if I'm that
        careless, you'll catch me." Alex's foot is placed by Quinn's only anchor to the ship and he kicks it up. Quinn laughs even louder as he declines to the
        sea but at that very moment, Alex grabs his foot to keep Quinn's back in the same place on the railing. Throwing his body up, Quinn glues his feet back
        to the floor, putting his hands on his hips as he directs a grin to Alex. Alex just rolls his eyes after Quinn kicks her leg.

            "Lets move to the shade," Alex says, already moving closer to the door. Quinn leans on the wall besides Alex who stands erect, arms hanging loose. 
        Without looking to Quinn, "What do you think is going to happen to the forest?" His face looks similar as if he were to look meaning within a passage, that
        the words used and arranged are done with a specific purpose in mind. Palms up and elbows down, "I hate to say but its not going to be there any longer.
        The land has already been bought and according to the new owners, malls would bring more visitors." Alex kicks the pole in front of her, she squints after.

            "What's more valuable, to live a more efficient life or life?" Alex hesitated to answer, knowing Quinn, she had to let the question simmer in her
        head before saying something. Anyone else would say the more efficient life since its better than the status quo but are those two what he is considering?

            Quinn then goes on with one of those soliloquy about the day, as if reciting what the muses want him to say. "Just two people walking on that island
        on that morning. Abandoned by the locals for a couple of weeks now and already seen as an obstacle for the inevitable future. Wood used for destroying
        wood and changing the ground to a tombstone of the land once there. It is best not to talk about the dying part since it is when something becomes brittle
        and undone."

            "A place that Artemis would command people to build her temple; children could run around, dodging trees and creating new adventures. We took it slow
        in comparison to them, our attention less wandering but more analytical. Asking question with a foundation that we agree on, to see where the ground would
        crack."
