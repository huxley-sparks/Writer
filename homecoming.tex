        A polished black (pointed suit heel shoe) oxford strikes the crumbled cement that plants tear apart to only meet with a sky that denies them a naked
    sun. Knee lifted to pass the jagged burst of earth; the pinstripe 3-piece suit continues his journey now on the center of the street. Cars that hit the
    curb too hard are left with the doors open, interior deteriorating, a few cars flip upside-down, some crashed into fences or walls. Scavenged for anything
    in the car that can produce heat, cars are left as the only corpses that don't rise again. Walking by this outside morgue of cars  (outside mall), he
    readjust his gas mask as he keeps his eyes on the sight in front of him.

        A circular disk that purifies the dead air that wanders the area is connected to the left side of the mask. Eyes hidden behind an opaque one way glass
    frame that extended from one side to another made him forget that he had a face. Despite being here before, everything seemed new and so distant from him.
    Coming here to see the sinking of the ship that he was able to transfer to another after being struck by a glacier  As he saw from the other ship, all the
    people trying to take all that they could from the ship without realizing that the lifeboats could suffice with human capacity. Few escape while the majority
    fell to the swarm, the sun being denied to them hence. He drops a few lifesavers, first-aid and blankets to improve the survivors chance of moving on yet
    he remembers to stay his distance as a orbiting arbiter.

        Bring back his hand from his extended arm, he grabs the revolver while keeping away from the hot tip, popping out the cylinder and finding two empty
    chambers. Putting back the gun on his holister, underneath his jacket; kicking the body that he corrects back into the right state, hating the fact that he
    miss the target on the first try. Coming with no backpacks, bags, suitcases or backup, the gun and knife as his tools at hand. The two shots being a vex,
    attracting the feet draggers. A persistence silence provides him solace in this gray day.

       Paint falls from the iron rods that are meant to prevent them from getting through, rust as infectious spores. Walking with hands in the suit's pockets, the]
    glass frame being below the filter and shoulders squeezed together, shaking a little. Stopping in front a two story house with a gate that consist of cement
    columns and iron gates in between, one foot facing the house while the other still parallel to the sidewalk. His sight first focuses on the surrounding area,
    looking for anything moving when wind isn't present. A can from inside an anonymous house falls, probably from a shelf that held on too long and finally
    gave in to the weight. He puts his sight to the sounds direction and waits a little, expecting to see another ghost in human skin. Gun in his hand, he closes
    his eyes and tries to hear footsteps within his radius.

       In the living room, he sees the sunlight enter through the vertical blinds as they set their shadows on the white squared-tiled floor. Sitting down with his
    back reclining on the seat and him reading a book in his hands  With the cars all away, he could hear the trees wave in the air. Reaching down besides him,
    he gets a glass of water and takes a drink, his sustainance that removes most of the excess. After breakfast, he's been reading for at least 5 hours with
    that cold water to prevent his stomach from growling. Extending his legs, he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes to see a picture of a steamer along
    a nile in Africa.

        At night, everyone is back in the house, restless. Television has nothing watching if there's no cable and the youth find the streets very enticing. 
    Parents start playing a game of dominoes on the table as the other kid takes another shower for his night out. The reader leaves when he the others are
    busy so he doesn't have to witness the same ritual that happens every time his brother goes out. First, the younger one doesn't tell them ahead of time that
    he's going out and then goes ad hominem on them. Parents respond by telling him to go back into his room. He says its not fair, they say
