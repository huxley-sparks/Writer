    Outline:  Running down an incline besides someone, choose which is the cause, away or to. 
                Mark: Audacity
                Frank: Fear
        Steps land hard on the concrete, heels touching the surface first before the toes and body slanted forward. Step after step, the same cycle
    is repeated with a pain transferred to the body. Breathe becomes valuable and rest not an option for the moment for these two. Where they run
    in comparison to each other doesn't matter, only that they are running in the same direction. Mark, the younger of the two, is behind the faster
    person, Frank. As for the reason which is similar since there is something behind them quickly trying to approach them and they would prefer 
    not to be acquainted.

        With Frank in the lead, Mark takes a look back to see the black fog getting nearer. The most that his legs retailerate with is to stall in
    the same distance from Frank as if tied by a rope and Frank was strong enough to keep him going. Frank didn't want to look back, to be reminded
    of what he was running for;  scared of what he fears might be inevitable if he tries to calculate the time it will take for the fog to capture them
    versus the time to arrive at the safe house. Swinging his arms with force that he could throw death behind him, Mark was amazed that he was able
    to keep up with Frank.

       What they both had to realize that one of them will have to be captured for escape to be possible. Judging by the speed behind them, the fog
    would be right next to them before arriving at the plaza. "We have to lose it there to get to safety without betraying the safe hold." Frank
    says aloud to Mark.

        As Mark runs, his legs start to feel void of energy, chest heavy and his heart beating close to the range of Frank. In the storm of craziness,
    he closes his eyes and imagines himself at the safe house, laying down with his back on the wall, dozing off while a girl talks to him. He can
    smell her perfume, thinking how the hell she manage to find that but only showing a smile as acknowledgment of the smell. She grabs his hand, encloses
    it in hers and puts in on top of her crossed legs. She rests her head on his shoulders and he feels the warmth radiating from the sunshine sitting
    so close to him. As she turns to him, she slaps him. Opening his eyes, he finds himself running through a pile of leaves in a park.

        Frank is now 5 meters ahead of him and the fog much closer than before. Running, he feels the sun bring him a blanket of heat on his skin as the
    orange light shines through the few remaining orange and yellow leaves on the branches of trees extending to the sky. Taking a deep breathe, he
    exhales with a burst of speed that closes the gap between him and Frank. Only 2 meters left in the space and again he is as at full ability. At this
    point though, Frank has already forgotten about Mark, his ears being filled by the stomping hiding in the fog behind them. No hesistation he thinks to
    himself, if Mark is capture, can't waste time to confirm it. No time to pity him now. The plaza is so close now.

       What sends a chill up their backs is that falls of trees for having seen them with such fortitude as they passed them only to hear them a minute later
    hit the ground with a shock and a brush of leaves. Frank was now hitting the ground with the balls of his feet while Mark was becoming more aware of his
    posture.

        Just to wake up with her besides him is all that he wanted, to see her open her eyes to greet the sun and the day, finding him and thinking the world
    does know she exists. She would wrap him in her arms and bring him up to him, squeezing him with bliss on her mind. His arms sprouting out of the hug to
    show how much he loves being with her, giving her a kiss on the cheek. They rest their head over the other's shoulder, her cheek glued to his as they
    smile.

        Back on the concrete, Mark can almost grab one of Frank's feet that quickly revolve under his body. Turning to see how close the fog is to them, he
    realizes that they have to finish now. The pressing deadline throws away anything in their head that is unnecessary weight; the day, time, who is chasing
    them and fatigue. Based on the speed, Frank has already thrown almost everything away while Mark was holding on to something. The fear Mark had for being
    captured couldn't throw away the thought that had cohesive between it and his head. Even with what power the fog has demonstrated, it wouldn't budge. Then
    another idea surface that he gave one glance before throwing away, how did Frank manage to throw everything away so easily?

        At the plaza, they ran under the concrete slab extending over the streets, from the buildings, that was supported by columns. After each pillar they pass,
    they hear it be torn down, either thrown to the street, to the building or some times even reaching them. This is where they have to lose the fog, a split in
    parallel running of the two. Whoever it choses to follow will in turn save the other from certain destruction while the former can only hope for a quick death.
    Frank was already hoping that he wouldn't be the choice the fog would go after when the split occurred. Mark wasn't thinking of that, he was already thinking
    of the room where she was staying. "I have to keep going," he thinks to himself.
