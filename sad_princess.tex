        "But its my car." She says pointing to the door, her car being beyond the house. On his side, Tyler stood looking at her with a
    fabricated indignation towards her. "You're not even allowed to drive." "I don't care. Its my car, I paid for it and if I decide not
    to let you use it, you DON'T USE IT!" She never screams, people could always hear when her words were bolded. "If you don't let me
    use the car, I'm going to tell them that you been driving recently without a license."

        Tyler and Alma, brother and sister from a Mexican family. The only reason why they're so honest in front of their parents is because
    neither parent understands English or even if they did, not with that speed nor altitude. 

        Their dad had finished about half of an eighteen pack of beer to make the workdays seem like a dream and was ready to leave until he
    noticed that he couldn't go alone. His wife, Maria, was still in the bathroom fixing her hair and the more time he spent in the home, the
    more irritated he became. From the couch, as he was watching the television and holding a beer in his hand, he let a yell that would 
    scared the sirens away from the ship to their mom. The beer in his hand bent to the point where it will remained wrinkled as changed the
    channels quicker to find something for him to do.

        Running down the stairs, Alma comes down with her blonde hair done, necklaces pouring down her shoulders besides the sparkles on her black
    dress and her small purse. She runs up to her dad, lifts him up, goes on her toes and kisses him on the cheek. She tells him in spanish that
    she is going to her friends house and that her friends are going to pick her up. He asks if she has any money, "Its okay, dad. I don't need
    money where I am going." After giving him a hug, she runs to the door until her dad calls her. Turning around, she finds a twenty dollar bill
    floating in the air with the help of his hand. "Really, dad. I'm fine. If I'm trouble, I'll call you. Its just a small get together in the city,
    I'll be okay."

        While they talked, black rimmed glasses descended the stairs as he kept his eyes away from touching the dirty ground. Clean from taking
    two showers that day, all he was going to do now was grab the keys and leave. As he approached the table, he saw that the keys were missing.
    "Mom!" he screams. "Mom! Where are the keys." Alma and her dad turn around as they are hugging around to the baby of the family, him being
    seventeen while she was twenty-one. "What is it?" Alma asks. Pointing his eyes away from her and facing his dad, "Where are the keys to the
    300?" He tells him it should be on the table. "No, its not. Where is it?" Their dad yells again to his wife, asking if she got the keys. She
    responds that she didn't get them today and if they checked the table for them.

        "You have it, don't you." He finally looks at her but only after he pointed to her first. Lowering her eyes to ajar, she looks at him with
    right eye brow raised. "You know that you've decided to hold grudge against me and yet you still want to borrow my stuff?" She rolls her eyes
    away from him. Just as she was walking out the door, she hears him repeat everything she said with the sound of her words going through a 
    blender. She knew that that was the only thing he could say since there was nothing else he could say to counter her arguments.

        But he didn't have to win her with words, his home field would always guarantee him a win. Opening the gate, she hears her dad yell again,
    this time it was for her. Clenching the top of the gate with her hands, she felt like reproaching daddy's little girl who was everything he
    wanted him to be. Tyler had a girlfriend. That was all their dad wanted from him and having accomplished that, the judge is apt to lean excessively
    on Tyler's side.

        Shrugging her shoulders, she turns around, climbs the steps and walks back inside with Tyler standing besides their father. "Give me the keys,"
    Tyler asks with his hand extended, palm up. She locks eyes with him as she her fortitude strong. Tyler then breaks the contact, turns to his dad
    and asks for him to make her do it. His dad tells her to hand it over. Keeping her eyes on the little boy, "No. Dad, if he treated me a little
    nicer, I would. He always acts condescending to me even though he doesn't what that word means."

        "I know what it means," he retorts. "Are you sure? Give me the definition." "So what, you can learn the definition from me." "Fine, then if
    you already know the definition, you shouldn't have a problem using it in a sentence." "I don't have to prove to you anything. Give me the keys."
