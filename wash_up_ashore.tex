            On beach, cold, lighthouse as company. Removing excess to achieve want. Buying cups of coffee,

        Fireworks shooting up to the sky as a sign from others that midnight has struck. Their attempt at making another sunrise fails at his recognition for
    the new day that will be coming. His only beacon of light at night that outshines the rest is the lighthouse that stands on top of a cliff where waves
    tackle into about every few seconds, as they always have been since he got there. Putting his hood over his head, hands into his pockets and squeezing his
    body together using his elbows. Clenching them into a fist is difficult for trying to make them bend is bending a small rod of metal. He knows that sitting
    near the shore is making matters worst for him, the cold being excruciating right after being thrown off by the waves.

        Covered in mostly in light on this night by the neglected moon hanging so close to the world and the few seconds of intense light from the revolving
    light. Still able to see himself in a blue-gray hue, he considers if this is what he really wants. He doesn't have to be in the cold; he could be inside
    a room with friends, alcohol, music, dancing, lcd screens and sparkles. To deviate of course from his friends house happened in a click, having a flashback
    of how the previous new year parties were like for him. To go again would just be practice that everyone decides to use to talk rather than anything else.
    The new year would be the only change in the room, the people only acting different momentarily until the alcohol wears off.

        He already has an idea of what he wants, to go to Ibiza, stay at a white marble apartment, rise in the morning with the sun shining down on him as he
    goes to get breakfast with others that are there, sipping coffee, reading newspapers while the streets are sparse of people. Hear a car pass by the 
    restaurant more than after the point that they forget cars exist. Non-elevator music, a station that the owner is fond of while he rests his head by the radio,
    taking people's orders with a piece of paper and pen, a placid yell that he exhorts to the cooks in the back. With only 5 guests in the restaurant, 12 round
    tables empty, the owner's tranquility persist.

        Tea, beans and eggs drenched lightly in red tomato sauce that glistens on the plate, besides his notebook and fountain pen. Writing some of his thoughts
    from the morning, he closes the notebook and starts eating. None of the meal comes with nutritional labels or endorsements, theirs origins close to the 
    restaurant. The music has a moment that the instruments play so low that they create the silence for the room. Sun rays casade to the floor, warming his
    feet which are wearing sandals. 

        A splash from a wave transfers him from his cloud to the sand; his left brain now becomes more active. Based on his salary, the hallucination is
    impossible. The airline ticket to Ibiza is at beyond what remains at the end of the month. What he did have enough for is to do the usual, like the party he
    should have been at instead of the beach, in the cold. As a child that refuses to believe that their pet is dead, he kept trying wake up his desire. To
    keep it a dream would mean that the year that is approaching will be exactly the same as the previous ones.

       "Is Ibiza what you really want?" he asked himself in his head. "Yes, nothing else matters." The light shines on him again as he says that and synapses start
    to spark, finding what to throw overboard to let the sinking ship reach the harbor. Starting from Day 1 in his life, Monday, he goes to wakes up, goes to work,
    goes home, goes out to eat, television, and sleep. Same cycle until Friday, with variety falling once in a while for those work days. "But what is my body
    numb to?"

        Recalling those days, most of his days were void of highlights. What he did routinely is go out to get coffee in the morning, buy clothes every other
    week and the such. Coffee now just went down him like cash, absent of flavor. His clothes he assumes now that they aren't made of paper. Taking out his
    notebook, he writes to make his own coffee at home and to stay with the clothes he has while the lighthouse lights him. Crossing those two unconscious
    acts in his life, his ship sinks about a mile away from the coast.

        "Something else." Inspect his life, his cellphone starts ringing. Pulling it out, he sees that the alarm is shaking the phone. Turning it off, he 
    thinks about how essential the phone is. Rarely does it make him lose opportunities with friends or life. The standard form of communication is email or
    internet. Ditching his cell phone for an online number, listening to voicemail or screening them out with the transcibed text makes his ship finish 3/4's
    of the mile. Giving a quick check of his cellphone for anything important, he stands up and throws it to the ocean as far as he can.
